These routines were used to simulate the ODE Pepperberg systems in our
paper. They were written in Matlab. Model parameters are specified in 
the data.m file, while the integration routines for the various 
biological messengers may be integrated by calling their appropriate 
routines in the other files with the parameters in data.m as arguments.
